## Summary

### What is a Crypto Wallet?

Software that stores your private keys and allows you to interact with the blockchain.

**Purposes:**
1. **Identity** - Your wallet address is like your "account" on the blockchain
2. **Authentication** - Proves you own an account without passwords
3. **Transaction signing** - Authorizes transactions using your private key

### Popular Solana Wallets

| Wallet | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Phantom** | Most popular Solana wallet |
| **Solflare** | Another well-known Solana wallet |
| **Backpack** | Newer wallet with xNFT support |

These are browser extension wallets, similar to MetaMask on Ethereum.

### Why Connect a Wallet?

When a dApp asks to "connect wallet," it requests:
1. **Your public address** - So it knows who you are
2. **Permission to request signatures** - For transactions you approve

The wallet **never shares your private key** with the website - it acts as a secure intermediary.

### Setup (Phantom)

1. Install Phantom from https://phantom.app/
2. Click "Create a new wallet"
3. **Write down your recovery phrase** (important!)
4. Set a password
5. Connect to the exam site by clicking "Phantom"
